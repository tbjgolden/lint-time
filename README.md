**`lint-time`** will run your linters of your choice against the files of your choice (like
`lint-staged`). It only checks staged files - i.e. files that have changed since the previous
commit.

It aims to achieve **_the same goal with a far smaller footprint_**.

When used with [`simple-git-hooks`](https://github.com/toplenboren/simple-git-hooks) or
[`husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky), it can lint your commits and block bad commits.

## Background

**Why not just use `lint-staged` instead?**

|                                      `lint-time` |                                      `lint-staged` |

## Install

This package is available from the `npm` registry.

```sh
npm install lint-time
```

## Usage

Put your scripts inside a `"lint-time"` array inside your `package.json` file.

```
  // ...
  "lint-time": [
    [
      "*.ts",
      "npx eslint"
    ],
    [
      "*.{ts,js,cjs,mjs,json}",
      "npx prettier --ignore-path .gitignore --write"
    ]
  ],
  // ...
```

And then to run on your staged files:

```sh
npx lint-time
```

> Note: the array order is respected when a staged file matches multiple scripts

## API

Exports a single function:

```ts
export declare const lintTime: () => Promise<boolean>;
```

`lintTime()` will not throw if the checks fail, but will throw if there's something unexpected with
your system (e.g. a malformed `package.json`).

```ts
import { lintTime } from "lint-time";

lintTime().then((wasSuccessful) => {
  console.log({ wasSuccessful });
});
```

Supports JavaScript + TypeScript.

Can also be imported via `require("lint-time")`.
